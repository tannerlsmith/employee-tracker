Getting Started
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 package (Links to an external site.) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.) to interact with the user via the command-line, and the console.table package (Links to an external site.) to print MySQL rows to the console.

IMPORTANT
You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to “upgrade” an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. Look into MySQL2's documentation (Links to an external site.) to make your queries asynchronous.

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:

Database schema includes tables labeled “employee,” role,” and “department.”

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

Department

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

Role

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

Employee

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name

last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name

role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role

manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is manager of the current employee. This field might be null if the employee has no manager.

You might want to use a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database. This will make the development of individual features much easier.

Bonus
See if you can add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

Update employee managers.

View employees by manager.

View employees by department.

Delete departments, roles, and employees.

View the total utilized budget of a department—in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
